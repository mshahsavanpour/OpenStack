    This filter allows the Cinder scheduler to provision volumes on a
    particular storage backend, as identified by the 'target_host' scheduler
    hint.

    To utilize this filter:

    1. Include the 'target_host' key in the scheduler hints when creating a
       volume, specifying the desired host for volume placement.

    2. Ensure that the 'TargetHostFilter' is added to the list of enabled
       filters in the Cinder scheduler configuration (`cinder.conf`):

       [DEFAULT]
       scheduler_default_filters = TargetHostFilter, <other_filters>

    Without the 'target_host' hint, this filter allows all backends to pass through,
    with fallback to other active filters for scheduling.
